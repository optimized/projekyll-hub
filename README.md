Project Hub
===========

A Jekyll powered of [Super Friendly / Dan Mall's Project Hub](https://github.com/SuperFriendly/project-hub/)

All "projects" come from the `_posts` directory. Edit the "[frontmatter](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/front-matter/)" for each post and place content in HTML or Markdown below.

Tag the posts as blank, "future" or "latest"

The posts will display in chronological order.

For local development, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. To serve to clients, commit to the gh-pages branch.

When you do this, you can serve a client portal publically, even if your repository is private.

For example, this site is available at https://optimized.github.io/projekyll-hub
